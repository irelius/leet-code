# General

This is a directory to keep track of the leetcode questions I'm solving.
This also utilizes mocha chai to have the testing environment on my local rather than on leetcode.

## Install Packagees

Run `npm i` at the root to install necessary packages/dependencies

## Running Tests

To the tests for a particular question, run `npm test tests/<test file>`

-   Ex: `npm test tests/1-two-sum.test.js`

## Creating New LeetCode Question
Run `npm run create <question name>`
